project ichiban

my first project! meant to be a portfolio + project all in one
it's going to constantly be a work in progress and still in its earliest stages but i'm okay taking my time with it. teaching myself html/css as i go, as well as other languages, inevitably. poor semantics and execution methods are to be expected. :D
