			<h5 id="hemni_site">[this site]</h5>
			<p>(brief explanation) i finished the last day of my first professional job working as a software developer the summer before my senior year, and decided i should really start working towards my postgrad life, aka prepping + a shit ton of leetcode, but i didn't feel like crying over some leetcode problems and have always wanted a portfolio in the form of a personal website. i also had the tiniest bit of experience in frontend development (aka my teenage years playing around with html and css on tumblr's theme editors) and hated the idea of using a site builder, so therefore this site was born! here's [INCLUDE HYPERLINK HERE] the github repo for this site, which includes all the html, css, ctml, hss you could ever want involved with creating this site. tbh this site does a great job as a portfolio, but i've enjoyed building it so much that it's more of a hobby than anything</p>
			<p>tldr:
				<ol>
					<li>need a job after college</li>
					<li>use tumblr as a child</li>
					<li>???</li>
					<li>profit</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>i'm always adding to + improving my site! keep up with all the newest changes and jiff updates <a href="patches.html">here</a></p>
